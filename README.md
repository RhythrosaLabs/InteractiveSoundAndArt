Overview:

Positioned at the four corners of the plane, floating spheres hover over pillars, emitting distinct sounds that change in accordance with the visitor’s proximity. Approach to increase in volume. Wander away to fade out. Inside the museum building, I have arranged a collection of artwork and animations. The artwork is displayed in a classic museum layout, with each piece curated to evoke a specific visual feel. As visitors explore the museum, they are simultaneously manipulating the audio with their motions. This results in the creation of an immersive, interactive audiovisual environment, where visitors are able to fine-tune the blend of the sonic aesthetic simply by walking around and observing. "Trinkets" aims to transport visitors to a world where sound and visuals harmonize and create a uniquely captivating experience.
